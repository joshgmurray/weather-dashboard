# Weather Dashboard
## Challenge Description
For this challenge I was asked to create a Weather dashboard that displays a 5 Day Forecast using the Open Weather API. 
## Acceptance Criteria
* WHEN a user type in a city to the search bar, THEN the API populates that cities current weather, along with a 5 day forecast for that cities next 5 days underneath the search bar.
## Work Completed
* Called to Open Weather API and targeted the specific data needed to provide accurate weather data for any given city by targeting latitude and longitute coordinata data.
* Converted API data from celcius to fahrenheit.
* Appended and styled data to page so that it displays cleanly for the user
* Ran a fetch command to work with search bar to let the user summon whatever city data they are looking for.
